About
--------

ShiftIt is an application for OSX that allows you to quickly manipulate window position and size using keyboard shortcuts. It intends to become a full featured window organizer for OSX.

This is a sub-fork from the original [ShiftIt][1] by [Aravindkumar Rajendiran][2] which is not longer under development, and builds upon other people's work to add a few things I like, such as one-sixth incremental window sizing and a "large tile" that occupies the left 2/3 of the screen like in some tiling window managers.

Version 1.5.2 adds Undo support - you can now restore previous window positions (as long as they were handled by ShiftIt)


EDIT: Window Margins removed.
